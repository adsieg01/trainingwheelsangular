## About TrainingWheels
Training Wheels is an app to gamify adulthood. The basic goal is to accumulate as many points as possible
by entering tasks you've performed, which you can select on the site. Each task has a designated number
of points, so more important or major tasks will give the user a much bigger jump in their rating.
The rating is a score-range-based assessment of what your present level of activity says about your
adulthood. There is also a page for noting personal goals or making notes or TODOs.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if
you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the
`-prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
